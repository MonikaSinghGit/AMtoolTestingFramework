	I recently learned of a poll being sponsored by a leading 
media conglomerate to identify the best popular song -- not of 
the year, the decade, or the century, but of the millennium.

Landini, the musical  sensation of 14th century Florence -- 
although admittedly his recordings are not easy to come by.  

But the poll organizers have the right idea.  Significant 
calendar changes -- and I can hardly think of a more significant 
one than the Year 2000 -- are natural watersheds: the time for 
sizing up the triumphs -- and mistakes -- of the past.  We’ve had 
plenty of both in banking during this century, and both -- the 
successes and the failures -- have something to teach us about 
the challenges we face today.  What history has to offer as 
guidance for the future is the subject I’d like to discuss with 
you this evening. 

The 20th century has seen three major banking crises, along 
with a host of minor ones.  Each had its own peculiar 
characteristics.  The crisis of 1907 to 1909 -- they were then 
called “panics” back then -- was the result of seasonal 
currency flows from the cities to the countryside that left too 
little cash in vault to sustain public confidence in the money

bankers made business decisions that were valid under one set of

decisions that determined the industry’s fate were those made in 
the flush of prosperity, when competition was vigorous, when even 
marginal borrowers had positive cash flows, and when every deal 
turned a profit -- at least at first.  Then as now, to paraphrase 
Thomas Paine, the good times are the times that try the banker’s 
character -- times when the pressures to ease loan underwriting 
standards, to cut back on internal controls, to reduce reserves, 
and generally to get caught up with a fast crowd, are hardest to 
resist.

dumbest and weakest competitors in the marketplace set the basic 
standard of pricing and credit terms.”  It was a race to the 
bottom, and, in his informed judgment, the primary responsibility 
for the disasters that followed rested with those who knew better 
but lacked the will -- the courage -- to take a stand for sanity 
in the financial marketplace. 

That observation should have special meaning for us today.  
For several years, OCC examiners have been reporting a troubling 
incidence of loans with structural weaknesses.  We’re seeing 
loans based on dubious business assumptions about the future 
income and cash-generating capabilities of the borrower.  We’re 
seeing loans with equity-like features and risk characteristics. 
 Some of these loans are based on so-called enterprise value, 
where loan amounts exceed the value of the borrower’s underlying 
assets.  And even though many of these loans are currently 
performing, we’re beginning to see rising levels of missed 
payments, defaults and bankruptcies among corporate borrowers.

 In a sense, some banks are the victims of their own success.  
Repeated years of unprecedented earnings have raised the bar of 
success, and bankers feel compelled to jump ever higher if they 
are to meet investor expectations.  With a limited number of good 
loans to be made, even in an expanding economy, and an increasing 
number of lenders eager to make them, the maintenance of market 
share must inevitably come at the expense of loan quality. 
I appreciate that at a time of record profits, it may be 
unrealistic to expect bankers to trim back their profitability 
and growth targets, and to turn their attention to the structural 
weaknesses of loans booked months or years ago.  Shareholders -- 
especially those fixated on short-term performance -- may react 
unfavorably to the diversion of earnings into loan loss reserves 
or to adding new staff to loan administration, audit, and workout 
departments.  In fact, such additions run the risk of adverse 
reactions from the market, which can also be personally costly 
for the banker whose compensation is geared to**************************:	0.10000000000000

variety of obstacles that prevented regulators from moving 
swiftly and efficiently to identify and resolve troubled 
institutions: the inadequacy of the deposit insurance funds; 
difficulties in coordination among the regulatory agencies; 
statutory limits on the regulators’ ability to close weakened 
banks; and reductions in the numbers and experience levels of 
examiners, brought about by pressures to reduce agency budgets.  

A number of important steps have been taken in recent years 
to address the supervisory shortcomings of a decade ago.  The 
FDIC Improvement Act, with its focus on prompt corrective action, 
should significantly reduce the prospect that institutions will 
be permitted to continue to operate in a condition of insolvency, 
 racking up greater and greater losses before they are closed.  
The bank insurance fund today is fully capitalized and fully 
prepared to meet virtually any contingency.  The regulatory 
agencies are constantly improving their supervisory capabilities
